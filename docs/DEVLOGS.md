# Dev Logs

## 09/2/25 12:54PM
Initial commit dedicated to basic project structure. For development, I want to start off just making basic movement work in a 3D space, and also displaying graphics in 3D. Once I get that to work, I will pivot to creating the movement and mechanics of the game I want to develop. Im hoping that having this game engine can be useful for any future projects I have, and i'll learn C++ and game engineering better.
